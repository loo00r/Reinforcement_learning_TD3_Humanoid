# Humanoid-v5: TD3 and DDPG Training and Comparison

This repository demonstrates and compares the performance of two reinforcement learning algorithms, TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) and DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), on the "Humanoid-v5" environment using Stable-Baselines3.

## Features

- **Algorithms**: TD3 and DDPG
- **Environment**: OpenAI Gym's "Humanoid-v5"
- **Visualization**: Compare rewards of both models over time
- **Training & Testing**: Train models and test the TD3 agent on a rendered environment

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install stable-baselines3 gymnasium numpy matplotlib
