https://www.loom.com/share/3cc1e7e954b54be7a74c273e6830d5d0?sid=6460f4e1-cf6a-41ca-a7bd-f048048abb9e

This repository demonstrates and compares the performance of two reinforcement learning algorithms, TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) and DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), on the "Humanoid-v5" environment using Stable-Baselines3.

## Features

- **Algorithms**: TD3 and DDPG
- **Environment**: OpenAI Gym's "Humanoid-v5"
- **Visualization**: Compare rewards of both models over time
- **Training & Testing**: Train models and test the TD3 agent on a rendered environment

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install stable-baselines3 gymnasium numpy matplotlib
